# fraction [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jason-ball/fraction.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jason-ball/fraction) [![Go](https://github.com/jason-ball/fraction/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jason-ball/fraction/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A simple fraction library for Go. Created to teach myself Go modules.

## How to use:

```go
import "github.com/jason-ball/fractions"

func main() {
    // Create two new fractions
    a := fraction.Fraction{3, 6}
    b := fraction.Fraction{25, 100}

    // Add them
    result := fraction.Add(a, b)

    // Result is automatically simplifed and formatted
    println(result.String())
    // Prints: 3/4
}
```

## How to run tests:

```bash
go test
```
